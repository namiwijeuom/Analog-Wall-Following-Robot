# Analog-Wall-Following-Robot

This is a group project done under the module Laboratory Practice and Projects , Semester 3 of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. 

The task description of the project is as follows.

1 Introduction

In recent years, robotics has become a major force among automation tasks.
Concepts of robotics are applied from small automation tasks to self driving
cars. In this challenge, you are tasked with building a simple wall following
robot using analog electronic components. For this, you have to measure the
distance from the robot to the side walls using analog sensors. Then using a
PID control circuit, you should generate a signal so that the robot tracks and
travels on the centerline between the walls.

2 Specifications

Build a simple wall following robot with a PID controller which keeps the robot
at the center as it travels.
* Use of analog distance measurement sensors
* Use analog electronics for the implementation (transistors, operational
amplifiers)
* Robot should be able to track the center-line between walls with minimum
latency
* Evaluated based on design, speed and performance of the robot
* A design with 2 motors will be sufficient
* You can use a robot kit with chassis (but you are encouraged to come up
with a custom design)
* Wall height is 7 cm
* The width between walls is 30 cm
* Maximum robot size is 15 cm x 15 cm

3 Additional Notes

* Any change of project specification is negotiable only before the mid review
* All circuits must be simulated using software (e.g., Multisim, LTspice,PLECs)
* All circuits should be tested on the breadboard and reviewed by the assigned
supervisor before moving further
* Circuits must be designed using professional EDA software (e.g., Altium
Designer, OrCAD)
* Schematics should be verified and evaluated by the assigned supervisor
* Design for manufacturability should be considered when designing the
PCB
* Complete set of design and manufacturing documents
– Schematics, Layout, 3D file
– Gerber files, Assembly files
– BoM must be generated and properly documented.
* Students are encouraged to procure components from international component distributors (e.g., Mouser, DigiKey, Arrow Electronics, LCSC)
* Students are encouraged to get the PCBs manufactured from international PCB manufacturers (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBway)
* Main functionality of the project must be achieved with basic electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors and other analog integrated circuits.
* Using any other pre-built programmable ICs are prohibited.
* Microcontrollers can be only used for user interface operation.
* Enclosure design must be done using a professional software (Solidworks)
* Enclosure and 3D model of the circuit must be assembled and inspected before manufacturing.
* 3D printing, Laser cutting and Sheet metal bending can be used to manufacture the enclosure.
* Students are encouraged to consider the 3D model and PCB co-design (design in parallel by taking their integration into consideration) when
designing.
* Final implementation of the project need to done in a PCB.
* Follow provided “General guidelines”.
